# WooCommerce SOAP-based Microservices Application

## Introduction

WooCommerce is a robust, SOAP-based e-commerce application designed with microservices architecture. It provides a comprehensive platform for managing online stores with multiple sellers, efficient order processing, and real-time notifications.

## Key Features

- Multi-seller support
- Order management (placement, confirmation, declination)
- Real-time stock updates
- Notification system for sellers and customers
- Logging service for system events
- SOAP-based API for all services

## System Architecture

WooCommerce follows Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, comprising several microservices:

### Entity Services (CRUD Operations)
- Customer Service
- Seller Service
- Order Service
- Product Service

### Utility Services
- Notification Service
- Logging Service

### Task Service
- ManageOrder Service (orchestrates other services)

### Common Service
- Holds shared schemas used across the system

## SOA Principles Implementation

1. **Schema Centralization**: Reuses predefined schemas, new schemas are created only when necessary.

2. **Loose Coupling**: Services are independent, with ManageOrder being the only service that consumes others.

3. **Abstraction**: Implementation details are hidden behind well-defined WSDL interfaces.

4. **Reusability**: Services are designed for maximum reusability.

5. **Autonomy**: All services except ManageOrder are self-dependent and autonomous.

6. **Statelessness**: Services do not maintain state between requests.

7. **Composability**: Services can be composed to create complex operations.

## Order Flow

1. Customer places an order (status: pending)
2. Notification sent to seller
3. Order placement logged
4. Seller confirms or declines the order
5. If confirmed:
   - Product stock updated
   - Notification sent to customer
   - Confirmation logged
